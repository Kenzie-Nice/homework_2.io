upon the two creations, mine is so simple compared to what i asked chat to make. which literally placed emojis, a page gradient and design into the page. where as mine is a simple color with a photo, with the console demands. At that point with how complex it went with the design alone, there is no way i could possibly and full explain the code. I would iwth more of the basic demands though. mainly of what is asked in java. 
I understand using AI to help with the code, goodness knows it has helped me in the past but i dont know how it would be to claim a site entirely of my own when i barely made it. esspeitally on a professional standard, iamgine creating a complex website and then in truth all you did was demand that chatgpt did it all. Which does raise a question though....if you ask for help on a basic layout of code...but revise and go in and change or rewrite things...did you write it as well or is it still all AI?
